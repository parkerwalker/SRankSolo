# League of Ledgers
---------------
League of ledges is a MEAN stack application meant to be used along side the moba game [League of Legends](http://play.na.leagueoflegends.com/en_US). The app is used to search others recent matches, lane match ups, most played champions, and add notes to specific lane matchups to search through when you find yourself in that same match up at a later date. This whole app was scoped and built in a little over 2 weeks.

You will need to install a CORS plug-in for your browser to use the application, [this is the extension I use](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-toggle/omcncfnpmcabckcddookmnajignpffnh?hl=en). If you want some players to search, you can use 'chowdog', 'brother dyrus', or 'scarra', who are all ex-pro players. You can also login with 'TrashTierTopLane' and passoword 'qq', which is my own personal player name to experiment with the notes function.
